        Short project description <br>
         The main goal of our project is to create a fun app based on memory games. We want to create a customizable experience for 
         the user with their own pictures. The players will be able to see their scores and compare them to other players’ scores. 
         Our intended audience is anyone who has access to a phone and wants to play memory games. Our app of minigames will be significant 
         to them because playing games using their own photo library will make the game more personal. The main functionalities of the game 
         will be a score tracker that will display the user’s score over time and a leaderboard. We will also include 4 minigames, Pattern 
         Replication, Simon, Match Two, and Moca Mashup. Pattern Replication will show the player a certain pattern of black squares overlaid 
         on an image, then the player will replicate the pattern by tapping certain sections. Simon will show the user a sequence on a 
         number of buttons in which the user must repeat the sequence in order. Match Two will show the user pairs of images which are 
         randomly arranged and the user will choose the two matching images. Lastly, Moca Mashup is a series of fast-paced tasks in which the 
         user must complete in time. The user will be able to import their photo library into the app and the games will be played using a random 
         selection of these photos. We’re developing the application using Unity and the database will be made using SQLite. The language will be 
         in C# and the app will support Android 5.1 and above and iOS 7.0 and above. We will be focusing our efforts primarily on reliability,
         since the user experience for the games is the main component. We are not focusing on security as of this moment, but maybe in the future
         we may work on this aspect. Lastly, safety isn’t a large component in video games without hardware so we will not be focusing on this property.
